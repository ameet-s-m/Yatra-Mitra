## 🎯 **JUDGES' QUESTIONS - PREPARED ANSWERS**

### Q: How is this different from existing apps?
**A:** "Existing apps focus on one thing - maps, booking, or safety. PRAVASI AI combines all three with AI-powered features like emotion detection, route learning, and accident detection that don't exist in current apps."

### Q: How does emotion detection work?
**A:** "We integrate with wearable devices to monitor heart rate and accelerometer data. When we detect elevated heart rate or sudden movements indicating panic, we automatically trigger emergency response with video streaming and location sharing."

### Q: Is this scalable?
**A:** "Yes, we use Firebase for real-time features, SQLite for local storage, and a service-based architecture that's easily scalable. The app works offline and syncs when online."

### Q: What's the business model?
**A:** "Freemium model - free safety features, premium for advanced analytics and booking commissions. Also partnerships with transport and hotel providers."

### Q: How accurate is the accident detection?
**A:** "We use Gemini AI's vision model which has high accuracy. Combined with location and context, we achieve reliable detection. Users can also manually report false positives to improve the system."
